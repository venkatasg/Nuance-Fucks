# Nuance Fucks

Code for producing figures in my [blog post](https://venkatasg.net/posts/nuance-fucks) on the
rise of 'nuance' in Computational Linguistics. You need to download the [ACL anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) 
bibliography file with abstracts to run the Jupyter Notebook, and create the csv.

If you're wondering why I don't use the F-word, I have a suspicion GitHub might
not like it.
